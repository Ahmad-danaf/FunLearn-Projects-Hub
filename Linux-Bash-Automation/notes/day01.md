# Day 1 â€“ Linux + Bash Basics

## Commands Practiced:
- cd, ls, pwd
- mkdir, touch, rm, cp, mv
- cat, less, head, tail
- echo, clear
- chmod, ./script.sh

## Flags That Stood Out:
- `-v` (verbose): really useful in `cp` and `mv` to see what's happening
- `-p`: used with `mkdir` to create nested directories safely
- `-r`: used in `cp` and `rm` to work with folders
- `-la`: used with `ls` to show detailed file info including hidden files

## Key Takeaways:
- Using variables like `$ROOT` in scripts is a game changer. It makes paths easier to manage and scripts more readable.
- I had used most commands before, but I hadn't explored their flags deeply. Learning to combine them made a big difference.
- Verbose output makes it easier to debug and verify what a script is doing.

## Script Summary:
- Created a folder structure for the day
- Created two files using `touch`
- Wrote to a text file
- Copied and renamed files
- Used `ls -la` to list the directory contents
